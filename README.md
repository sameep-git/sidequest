## 🚀 Features

### 📍 Location-Based Bounties
Never walk past a grocery store without knowing what your household needs. Sidequest uses geofencing to notify you the moment you're near a store with active "bounties" (shopping list items).

### 🧾 Magic Receipt Scanning
Stop typing in prices manually. Snap a photo of your receipt, and our AI (powered by Apple Vision) instantly:
- Identifies every item and price.
- Handles complex tax and tip calculations.
- Allows you to assign items to specific roommates with a tap.

### 💰 Fair Expense Splitting
Built-in ledger tracks who paid for what. Settle debts easily and keep the household finances balanced without the awkward conversations.

### 🏆 Gamified Shopping
Earn bounties for being the one to pick up the milk. Turn errands into opportunities to help your house and get rewarded.
